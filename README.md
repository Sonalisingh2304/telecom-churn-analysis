# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis (7K Customers)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn behavior in a telecom company using Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
The goal is to identify the key factors that drive churn and translate findings into actionable business recommendations to improve retention.

## Dataset
- ~7,000 telecom customers
- Features include demographics, contract type, billing/payment methods, and service usage
- Target variable: **Churn** (`Yes` = customer left, `No` = customer stayed)

## Key Insights (Highlights)
- **Contract type** is a major driver: month-to-month customers churn the most.
- **Payment method** matters: electronic check users show the highest churn, while auto-pay customers churn less.
- **Support & protection services** reduce churn: tech support, online security, and online backup are strongly linked to retention.
- **Internet service** impact: fiber customers churn more, suggesting an expectation–experience gap.
- **Customer stability factors**: customers without partners/dependents churn more.
- **Low-impact factors**: gender and phone service show minimal churn difference.

## Business Recommendations
- Convert month-to-month customers to long-term contracts using incentives and loyalty offers.
- Promote **auto-pay** adoption (bank transfer/credit card) with discounts or rewards.
- Bundle and upsell value-added services (tech support, security, backup) to increase customer stickiness.
- Improve onboarding in the first 30–60 days (check-ins, setup assistance, early issue resolution).
- Provide premium support experience for fiber customers to match higher expectations.
